Help Out
========

So you want to help out, eh? Here's what you can do:

Code
----

This project is coded mainly in C, and should at the very
least support Linux (deployment) and OSX (testing). Try not
to use any OS specifc features that are not on both of these
OSes.

Speed is of paramount importance. At the same time, stability
is more important - random crashing servers are a problem.

Finally, if you decide to begin contributing, [introduce yourself
in an issue](https://github.com/haneefmubarak/sfDB5/issues/new)
and tell what it is you want to work on. Or just send a pull
request. Either works.
