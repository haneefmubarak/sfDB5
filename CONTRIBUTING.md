Help Out
========

So you want to help out, eh? Here's what you can do:

Code
----

This project is coded mainly in C, and should at the very
least support Linux (deployment) and OSX (testing). Try not
to use any OS specifc features that are not on both of these
OSes.

Speed is of paramount importance. At the same time, stability
is more important - random crashing servers are a problem.

Finally, if you decide to begin contributing, [introduce yourself
in an issue](https://github.com/haneefmubarak/sfDB5/issues/new)
and tell what it is you want to work on. 

Testing
-------

We're not really at that stage yet, sorry. But if you can sponsor
a VM for test builds, that'd be great (see below)!

Sponsorships
------------

I don't want any sponsorships from this just about yet. However,
there are various things that would be extremely useful to have
available for development and testing, so if you're looking to
sponsor something, these might be your thing (ordered by importance):

|Cost (USD)	|Item(s)	|Reason		|Priority	|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|$150+ month	|Linode VMs	|Cluster Development, Testing, etc.|**HIGH**|
|$60+ month	|Terminal.com	|Quick Online Development, Optimized Profile Manual Builds, etc.|_low_|


Preferably, any of the above could be delivered as credit for a particular
service, if that service supports it. Additionally, if can find another
sponsor to co-sponsor an item with (so you each only sponsor part of the item),
that's okay too. If you think you can sponsor/co-sponsor an item, contact me
at one of the following:
