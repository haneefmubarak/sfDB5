Help Out
========

So you want to help out, eh? Here's what you can do:

Code
----

This project is coded mainly in C and supports Linux (>= 3.4). Use
only things that are documented, and when possible, try not to use
functionality that is exceptionally Linux specific. Ask if you have
questions.

Speed is of paramount importance. At the same time, stability
is more important - random crashing servers are a problem.

Finally, if you decide to begin contributing, [introduce yourself
in an issue](https://github.com/haneefmubarak/sfDB5/issues/new)
and tell what it is you want to work on. Or just send a pull
request. Either works.
